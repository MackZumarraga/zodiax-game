## Core Game Mechanics

### Base Stats
- **Health Points (HP)**: 100
- **Mana Points (MP)**: 15
- **Turn System**: Randomized starting player, alternating turns

### Combat Mechanics
- **Damage Reduction**: Block provides 50% damage reduction
- **Damage Reflection**: Block reflects 25% of incoming damage back to attacker
- **Status Effects**: Blocking status lasts one turn
- **MP Management**: Skills consume MP, charge skill restores MP

## Skill Balance

### 🗡️ Attack
**Current Stats:**
- Damage: 1-35 (average: 18)
- MP Cost: 0
- Target: Enemy

**Balance Reasoning:**
- Reduced from 1-49 damage to create more tactical gameplay
- Lower damage encourages use of MP-based skills
- Free MP cost makes it a reliable fallback option
- 6 turns to kill on average promotes strategic MP usage

### 🔮 Curse
**Current Stats:**
- Damage: 25-40% of enemy's max HP (25-40 damage, average: 32.5)
- MP Cost: 6
- Target: Enemy

**Balance Reasoning:**
- Reduced from 60-80% damage to prevent 2-shot kills
- Reduced MP cost from 7 to 6 to match heal efficiency
- Damage per MP: 5.4 (balanced with heal efficiency of 5.0)
- Can cast 2+ curses per battle with 15 MP pool
- Still powerful but no longer overpowered

### 💚 Heal
**Current Stats:**
- Healing: 20-40% of max HP (20-40 healing, average: 30)
- MP Cost: 6
- Target: Self

**Balance Reasoning:**
- Increased MP cost from 5 to 6 to balance with curse
- Heal per MP: 5.0 (closely matches curse damage per MP)
- Provides sustainable gameplay without being overpowered
- Can cast 2+ heals per battle, enabling defensive strategies

### 🛡️ Block
**Current Stats:**
- Damage Reduction: 50%
- Damage Reflection: 25% of original damage
- MP Cost: 0
- Target: Self

**Balance Reasoning:**
- Added damage reflection to make blocking more valuable
- Free MP cost encourages tactical usage
- Creates risk/reward dynamic for attackers
- Provides counter-play option against aggressive strategies
- No longer a "dead turn" - now actively punishes attackers

### ⚡ Charge
**Current Stats:**
- MP Gain: 2-3 (average: 2.5)
- MP Cost: 0
- Target: Self

**Balance Reasoning:**
- Reduced from 3-5 MP gain to prevent MP inflation
- Still enables extended battles and comeback mechanics
- Balanced to require 2-3 charges for high-cost skills
- Prevents infinite MP loops while maintaining utility

## Balance Changes History

### Original Balance Issues
1. **First-Player Advantage**: 76.7% vs 23.3% win rate
2. **Overpowered Curse**: 60-80% damage could 2-shot opponents
3. **Limited MP Pool**: Only 10 MP restricted strategic options
4. **Weak Block**: No offensive benefit, rarely used
5. **Attack Too Strong**: 1-49 damage made skills less valuable

### Applied Fixes

#### 🎲 Turn Order Randomization
- **Problem**: First player had massive advantage
- **Solution**: Randomized starting player each battle
- **Result**: Eliminated first-player bias

#### ⚔️ Damage Rebalancing
- **Attack**: 1-49 → 1-35 damage
- **Curse**: 60-80% → 25-40% max HP damage
- **Reasoning**: Promotes skill usage over basic attacks

#### 🔵 MP Economy Improvements
- **MP Pool**: 10 → 15 total MP
- **Curse Cost**: 7 → 6 MP
- **Heal Cost**: 5 → 6 MP
- **Charge Gain**: 3-5 → 2-3 MP
- **Result**: More strategic depth, balanced efficiency

#### 🛡️ Block Enhancement
- **Added**: 25% damage reflection
- **Kept**: 50% damage reduction
- **Result**: Block now provides tactical value

## Strategic Analysis

### Skill Efficiency Comparison
| Skill | Avg Effect | MP Cost | Efficiency | Use Case |
|-------|------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Attack | 18 damage | 0 | ∞ | Consistent damage |
| Curse | 32.5 damage | 6 | 5.4 | Burst damage |
| Heal | 30 healing | 6 | 5.0 | Sustainability |
| Block | 50% reduction + 25% reflect | 0 | ∞ | Counter-play |
| Charge | 2.5 MP | 0 | ∞ | Resource management |

### Viable Strategies
1. **Aggressive**: Curse → Curse → Attack spam
2. **Defensive**: Heal → Block → Counter-attack
3. **Balanced**: Mix of all skills based on situation
4. **Resource Control**: Charge → High-cost skills

### Battle Flow Analysis
- **Early Game** (Turns 1-2): High MP usage (Curse/Heal)
- **Mid Game** (Turns 3-4): Mixed strategies, block usage
- **Late Game** (Turns 5+): Attack spam or charge/skill combos

## Testing Methodology

### Simulation Details
- **Sample Size**: 1000 battles per test
- **AI Strategy**: Simple but effective decision tree
- **Randomization**: Full RNG for damage/healing values
- **Turn Order**: Randomized starting player
- **Victory Conditions**: HP reduction to 0 or below

### AI Decision Tree
1. Low HP + sufficient MP → Heal
2. Sufficient MP → Curse
3. Low MP → Charge
4. Low HP + enemy attacking → Block
5. Default → Attack

### Balance Criteria
- **Well Balanced**: Win rate difference < 5%
- **Minor Issues**: Win rate difference 5-10%
- **Major Issues**: Win rate difference > 10%
